# Day 4: Python Data Structures In-Depth

A comprehensive guide to understanding Python's core data structures, focusing on the fundamental concepts of variable references, mutability vs immutability, and the practical application of strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.

## 📚 Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will understand:

- 🔗 **Variable References** - How Python variables work as labels pointing to objects, not containers holding data
- 🔄 **Mutability Concepts** - The crucial distinction between mutable and immutable objects
- 📝 **String Operations** - Indexing, slicing, and essential string methods for text manipulation
- 📋 **List Manipulation** - Working with Python's most versatile mutable data structure
- 📦 **Tuple Usage** - Understanding immutable containers and tuple packing/unpacking
- 🗂️ **Dictionary Operations** - Key-value pair management and safe data access techniques
- 🎯 **Set Operations** - Unique collections and powerful set-based computations

## 🔍 Key Concepts Overview

### Variables as References, Not Containers

One of the most important concepts in Python is understanding that **variables are labels that point to objects in memory**, not boxes that contain data.

```python
x = 100
y = x  # Both x and y point to the SAME object in memory
print(id(x) == id(y))  # True - they have identical memory addresses
```

**Key Insight**: When you assign a variable in Python, you're creating a reference to an object's memory location, not copying the data itself.

### Mutable vs Immutable Objects

This fundamental distinction affects how Python handles data modifications:

#### Immutable Objects
- **Cannot be changed in-place** after creation
- Any "modification" creates a new object in memory
- **Examples**: `int`, `float`, `str`, `tuple`, `frozenset`

```python
city = "Peshawar"
original_id = id(city)
city = city + ", Pakistan"  # Creates NEW string object
print(id(city) != original_id)  # True - different object
```

#### Mutable Objects  
- **Can be modified in-place** without creating a new object
- The object's memory address remains constant during modifications
- **Examples**: `list`, `dict`, `set`

```python
subjects = ["Math", "Physics"]
original_id = id(subjects)
subjects.append("Chemistry")  # Modifies existing object
print(id(subjects) == original_id)  # True - same object
```

## 📖 Data Structures Deep Dive

### 🔤 Strings (Immutable, Indexed, Iterable)

Strings are immutable sequences of characters that support powerful text manipulation methods.

#### Key Characteristics:
- **Immutable**: Every operation creates a new string
- **Indexed**: Access characters by position (0-based indexing)
- **Iterable**: Can loop through each character

#### Essential Methods:
```python
text = "pakistan is beautiful"

# Case manipulation
text.capitalize()      # "Pakistan is beautiful"
text.upper()          # "PAKISTAN IS BEAUTIFUL"

# Search and replace
text.find("beautiful") # Returns index: 12
text.replace("pakistan", "Pakistan")

# Splitting and joining
words = text.split()   # ['pakistan', 'is', 'beautiful']
" ".join(words)        # Rejoin with spaces
```

#### Practice Exercises:
1. Given the string `s = "Digital Pakistan"`, use slicing to print just "Digital"
2. Take the string `"I love programming"` and replace `"programming"` with `"AI"`
3. Use the `.upper()` method to convert your name to capital letters

### 📋 Lists (Mutable, Indexed, Iterable)

Lists are Python's most versatile data structure - ordered, changeable collections.

#### Key Characteristics:
- **Mutable**: Modify elements, add/remove items in-place
- **Indexed**: Access elements by position
- **Ordered**: Maintains insertion order

#### Essential Methods:
```python
cities = ["Lahore", "Karachi", "Islamabad"]

# Adding elements
cities.append("Peshawar")           # Add to end
cities.insert(1, "Quetta")         # Add at specific position

# Removing elements
cities.remove("Karachi")            # Remove by value
last_city = cities.pop()            # Remove and return last item

# Organization
cities.sort()                       # Sort alphabetically
cities.reverse()                    # Reverse order
```

#### Practice Exercises:
1. Create a list of numbers from 1 to 5, then insert 100 at index 2
2. Create a list of favorite foods and use `.pop()` to remove the last item
3. Create a list of Pakistani cities and sort them alphabetically

### 📦 Tuples (Immutable, Indexed, Iterable)

Tuples are immutable sequences ideal for storing related data that shouldn't change.

#### Key Characteristics:
- **Immutable**: Cannot modify after creation
- **Ordered**: Elements have a defined order
- **Allow Duplicates**: Same values can appear multiple times

#### Tuple Packing and Unpacking:
```python
# Packing: Creating tuple
student_record = ("Ahmed", 25, "Computer Science")

# Unpacking: Extracting values
name, age, major = student_record

# Useful methods
grades = ("A", "B", "A", "C", "B")
grades.count("A")    # Count occurrences: 2
grades.index("C")    # Find first position: 3
```

#### Practice Exercises:
1. Create a tuple with student ID, name, and GPA, then unpack into variables
2. Create a tuple with duplicate numbers and count occurrences of a specific number

### 🗂️ Dictionaries (Mutable, Keyed, Iterable)

Dictionaries store data in key-value pairs, providing fast lookups and flexible data organization.

#### Key Characteristics:
- **Mutable**: Add, modify, remove key-value pairs
- **Keyed Access**: Use keys instead of numeric indices
- **Unique Keys**: Each key can appear only once

#### Safe Data Access:
```python
student = {"name": "Fatima", "course": "AI/ML"}

# Safe access with .get()
age = student.get("age", "Not provided")  # Avoids KeyError

# Iteration patterns
for key, value in student.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")

# Dictionary manipulation
student.pop("course")              # Remove and return value
student.update({"city": "Peshawar"})  # Add/update multiple items
```

#### Practice Exercises:
1. Create a product dictionary with 'name', 'price', and 'in_stock' keys
2. Use `.get()` method to safely check for a 'discount' key
3. Use a `for` loop with `.items()` to print all key-value pairs

### 🎯 Sets (Mutable, Unordered, Iterable)

Sets are unordered collections of unique elements, perfect for eliminating duplicates and set operations.

#### Key Characteristics:
- **Unique Elements**: Automatically removes duplicates
- **Unordered**: No defined sequence or indexing
- **Mutable**: Add and remove elements

#### Powerful Set Operations:
```python
python_skills = {"Python", "Django", "Flask"}
ai_skills = {"Python", "TensorFlow", "NumPy"}

# Set operations
all_skills = python_skills | ai_skills        # Union
common_skills = python_skills & ai_skills     # Intersection  
unique_to_python = python_skills - ai_skills  # Difference

# Membership testing (very fast)
"Python" in python_skills  # True
```

#### Practice Exercises:
1. Create a list with duplicate city names and convert to a set for unique cities
2. Create two sets of friends' names and find friends unique to the first set
