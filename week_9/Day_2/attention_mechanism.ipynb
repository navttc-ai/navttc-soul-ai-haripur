    "\n",
    "Older models, like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), had to process information in a strict sequence, trying to cram the meaning of a whole sentence into a single memory state. This was like trying to remember the beginning of a very long story by the time you reach the end – it's tough! They often forgot important early details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attention solves this by giving the model the ability to \"look back\" at the entire input at every step. It dynamically decides which parts of the input are the most important for the current task.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conceptual Example: Machine Translation**\n",
    "\n",

    "*   **English:** \"The cat sat on the mat.\"\n",
    "*   **French:** \"Le chat s'est assis sur le tapis.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "When the model is generating the French word `chat` (cat), the attention mechanism would assign a **high weight** (high importance) to the English word `cat`. Similarly, when generating `tapis` (mat), it would focus heavily on the word `mat`. This allows for a much more accurate and context-aware translation!"
