Setting Up Your AI Development Environment: A First Session Guide
This tutorial, based on the NAVTTC AI Course, will guide you through the essential first steps of becoming an AI developer. In this session, you'll learn a simple definition of AI, see how it's used in Pakistan, and get hands-on experience by setting up your development environment and writing your first Python code. By the end, you'll have a clear understanding of the course roadmap and be ready to begin your three-month AI journey.

üíª What is AI?
AI teaches computers to think and learn like humans, allowing them to learn from examples and find patterns in data. Unlike traditional software, which follows pre-written, unchanging rules (like a calculator), AI software learns from data and improves over time (like Netflix recommendations).

AI Around You in Pakistan
You're likely already using AI daily without realizing it. Here are some examples:

Careem: Predicts ride prices based on demand.

Foodpanda: Recommends restaurants you might like.

JazzCash/EasyPaisa: Detects fraudulent transactions.

Afiniti Call Centers: Uses voice recognition AI.

Bank Apps: Provides automatic fraud detection.

üöÄ Your 3-Month AI Journey
This course is designed to take you from a beginner to an AI developer in three months, culminating in your own AI project.

Month

Weeks

Focus Area

Key Concepts/Projects

1

1-4

Python Fundamentals

Python basics, variables, data types, control structures (loops, conditions, functions). You'll build a mini-project like a simple calculator or quiz game.

2

5-8

Data Analysis & Machine Learning

Working with data (reading Excel files), data cleaning, basic statistics, and first machine learning projects (e.g., predicting house prices or student grades).

3

9-12

Deep Learning & AI Projects

Deep learning basics, neural networks, image recognition, and building a final capstone AI application to present to the class.

üîß Setting Up Your Development Environment
To start your journey, you'll need to install Anaconda, a platform that includes Python and other essential tools like Jupyter Notebook.

Step 1: Install Anaconda
Go to anaconda.com/products/distribution.

Download the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows or Mac).

Run the installer and use the default settings.

Step 2: Launch Jupyter Notebook
Open Anaconda Navigator.

Click Launch under the Jupyter Notebook icon.

Jupyter Notebook will open in your default web browser.

Step 3: Create Your First Notebook
In the Jupyter Notebook interface, click New in the top-right corner.

Select Python 3 from the dropdown menu.

Rename your new notebook by clicking on Untitled at the top and changing the name to first_ai_session.ipynb.

‚úçÔ∏è Your First Python Code
Now you're ready to write and run your first lines of code!

Hello, AI World!
In the first code cell, type the following:

print("Hello, AI World!")

Press Shift + Enter to run the code. The output Hello, AI World! will appear below the cell.

Working with Variables
Variables are used to store information. Let's create some and use them in a print statement.

In a new cell, type the following code:

name = "Ali"
age = 20
print("My name is", name)
print("I am", age, "years old")

Run the code to see the output.

Using Loops
Loops allow you to repeat a block of code, which is fundamental for AI to process large amounts of data.

This loop will count from 0 to 4:

for i in range(5):
  print("Count:", i)

Loops are used in AI for tasks such as analyzing thousands of exam marks, processing individual pixels in an image, and checking millions of messages for spam.
