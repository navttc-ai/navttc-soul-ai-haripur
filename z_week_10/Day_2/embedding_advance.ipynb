    "\n",
    "Word embeddings are numerical representations of words. Think of them as coordinates for each word in a multi-dimensional 'meaning space'. \n",
    "\n",
    "This technique allows words with similar meanings to have similar vector representations (similar coordinates). This is how we get computers to understand that 'cat' is more similar to 'dog' than it is to 'car'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea comes from the **distributional hypothesis**: *\"You shall know a word by the company it keeps.\"* This means words that appear in similar sentences (or contexts) are likely to have similar meanings."

    "## Topic 2: Why Not Just Use Numbers? (Old Methods)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we had smart embeddings, we had simpler methods. One of the most basic is **One-Hot Encoding**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine our entire vocabulary is just five words: `['the', 'cat', 'sat', 'on', 'mat']`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To represent the word 'cat', we create a vector that is all zeros, except for a '1' at the position for 'cat'.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `the`: `[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n",
    "- `cat`: `[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]`\n",
    "- `sat`: `[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]`\n",
    "\n",
    "This seems simple, but it has big problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "👎 **High Dimensionality**: If you have a vocabulary of 50,000 words, each vector will have 50,000 dimensions! This is computationally very expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "👎 **Sparsity**: The vectors are mostly zeros, which is not efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "👎 **No Semantic Relationship**: The vectors for 'cat' and 'dog' are no more similar than the vectors for 'cat' and 'car'. The model can't see any relationship between words."

    "## Topic 3: Static Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText)\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the problems of one-hot encoding, researchers created **static word embeddings**. These models learn a single, fixed vector for each word from a huge amount of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Word2Vec (Google, 2013)\n",
    "A groundbreaking model that learns word associations. It has two main 'flavors':\n",
    "- **CBOW (Continuous Bag-of-Words):** Predicts a target word from its context. (e.g., given `['The', 'cat', 'on', 'the', 'mat']`, predict `sat`). It's fast and good for common words.\n",
    "- **Skip-Gram:** Predicts the context words from a target word. (e.g., given `sat`, predict `['The', 'cat', 'on', 'the', 'mat']`). It's slower but excellent for representing rare words.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### GloVe (Stanford, 2014)\n",
    "GloVe stands for **Global Vectors**. It learns by looking at how often words appear together across an entire corpus, giving it a more 'global' understanding of language.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### FastText (Facebook, 2016)\n",
    "FastText's superpower is handling **out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words**. It breaks words down into character parts (n-grams). So, if it has never seen the word `embedding`, but it has seen `embed` and `ing`, it can create a reasonable vector for the new word. This is great for languages with many word forms."
