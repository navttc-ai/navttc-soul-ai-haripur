    "### What is Gensim?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gensim** (which stands for \"Generate Similar\") is a fantastic open-source Python library for NLP. It's famous for being highly efficient, especially with large text collections, because it can process text in a streaming fashion (meaning it doesn't need to load everything into memory at once!).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Word Embeddings?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you could represent words as numbers in a way that captures their meaning and relationships. That's exactly what **word embeddings** do! They are dense vector representations of words in a multi-dimensional space. The core idea is simple: **words that appear in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings.** For example, the vectors for \"king\" and \"queen\" would be much closer to each other than the vectors for \"king\" and \"apple\"."
