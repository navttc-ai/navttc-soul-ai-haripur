    "Imagine you had to represent every word in the dictionary as a number. An easy way would be to assign a unique ID to each word. This is called **One-Hot Encoding**.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this method has two big problems:\n",
    "1.  **It's Inefficient:** If you have 10,000 words, each word's representation is a list with 9,999 zeros and only one '1'. That's a lot of wasted space!\n",
    "2.  **It's Not Smart:** The vectors for \"cat\" and \"dog\" are no more related than the vectors for \"cat\" and \"car\". It doesn't capture any meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Word Embeddings solve this!** They represent words as dense, multi-dimensional vectors (like `[0.2, -0.4, 0.7, ...]`). The magic is that words with similar meanings are placed close to each other in this vector space."
