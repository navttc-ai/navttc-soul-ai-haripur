    "\n",
    "1.  **What is an RNN?** Understand the core idea of 'memory' in neural networks.\n",
    "2.  **How do they work?** Learn about the simple math behind an RNN's feedback loop.\n",
    "3.  **Types of RNNs:** Discover different RNN architectures for different problems (e.g., sentiment analysis, text generation).\n",

This makes it very hard for the network to learn connections between distant events in a sequence (long-term dependencies).\n",

    "\n",
    "- **RNNs are for Sequential Data:** Their defining feature is the ability to process sequences by maintaining a 'memory' or **hidden state**.\n",
    "- **The Power of the Loop:** The recurrent connection allows information to be passed from one time step to the next.\n",
    "- **Training with BPTT:** RNNs are trained using Backpropagation Through Time.\n",
    "- **Beware of Gradients:** Simple RNNs are susceptible to the vanishing and exploding gradient problems.\n",
    "- **Architectural Diversity:** RNNs come in various forms (many-to-one, one-to-many, etc.) to suit different problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations on completing this introduction to RNNs! This is a foundational concept in modern AI, and understanding it well will help you learn more advanced models like LSTMs, GRUs, and Transformers."
