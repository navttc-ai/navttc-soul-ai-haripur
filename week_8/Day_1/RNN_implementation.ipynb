    "Imagine reading a sentence. You don't just read each word in isolation; you remember the words that came before it to understand the full meaning. An RNN works in a similar way! It has a 'memory' that allows it to retain information from previous steps in a sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes RNNs perfect for tasks like:\n",
    "- **Sentiment Analysis:** (What we're doing today!) Is a review positive or negative?\n",
    "- **Machine Translation:** Translating a sentence from one language to another.\n",
    "- **Text Generation:** Writing new text that looks like it was written by a human.\n",

    "Congratulations on building your first sentiment analysis model! To reinforce what you've learned, here are a few tasks to practice at home.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task 1:** Find a real movie review online (from a site like Rotten Tomatoes or IMDb) and test it with the prediction code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task 2:** Re-run the model training (`model.fit(...)`) but this time for `5` epochs instead of `3`. Does the final accuracy on the test set improve or get worse?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task 3:** In the model building step, change the number of memory units in the `SimpleRNN` layer from `32` to `64`. Re-train and evaluate the model. How does this change affect the number of trainable parameters and the final accuracy?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task 4:** Write a very short, one-word review like \"amazing\" or \"bad\". Does the model correctly predict the sentiment?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task 5:** The `preprocess_text` function uses `word_index.get(word, 2)`. The `2` is a default value for words not found in the vocabulary. Try writing a review with lots of made-up words (e.g., \"The flibbertigibbet was truly scrumdiddlyumptious\") and see how the model responds."
