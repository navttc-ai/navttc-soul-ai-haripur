    "# 🎬 LSTM for IMDb Movie Review Sentiment Analysis\n",

    "Welcome to this 2-hour session on using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for sentiment analysis! We'll build a model to predict whether a movie review is positive or negative. \n",

    "\n",
    "1.  **Understand Sentiment Analysis:** Learn what it is and why it's important.\n",
    "2.  **Prepare Text Data:** Preprocess the IMDb movie review dataset for our AI model.\n",
    "3.  **Build an LSTM Model:** Create a neural network using LSTMs, a special type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).\n",
    "4.  **Train & Evaluate:** Train our model and see how well it performs.\n",
    "5.  **Test with Your Own Reviews:** Predict the sentiment of any review you type!\n",
    "6.  **Why LSTMs are better than RNNs for text:** Understand the improvement LSTMs offer for handling long sentences."

    "`\"I went to see this film last week with my friends, and while the popcorn was a bit stale, the cinematography reminded me of the classic movies from the 1960s, which I adore, but the plot was so confusing and poorly written that by the end, I have to say it was a **terrible** experience.\"`\n",

    "\n",
    "**LSTMs solve this!** They have a special memory cell and gates (input, output, forget gates) that allow them to remember or forget information selectively. This makes them excellent at understanding the context in long sentences, leading to much better performance on tasks like sentiment analysis of detailed reviews."

    "## 🎉 Final Revision Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations on building your first sentiment analysis model with LSTMs! To practice and reinforce what you've learned, here are a few tasks you can try at home.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task 1: The Sarcastic Review**\n",
    "-   Write a sarcastic review like `\"Wow, another two hours of my life I'll never get back. Truly a masterpiece of boring cinema.\"` and see if the model can correctly classify it as negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task 2: The Mixed Feelings Review**\n",
    "-   Write a review with both positive and negative points, like `\"The special effects were incredible, but the story was weak and predictable.\"` See which way the model leans.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task 3: Change Model Parameters**\n",
    "-   Go back to the model building cell (`Topic 5`). Try changing the number of LSTM units from `64` to `32` or `128`. Re-train the model and see how the accuracy changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task 4: Change `maxlen`**\n",
    "-   In `Topic 3`, change the `maxlen` parameter from `200` to `300`. How does this affect training time and accuracy? Do you think it would help or hurt the model's performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task 5: Explore the Vocabulary**\n",
    "-   Write a short script to see what word corresponds to a specific number. For example, what word is represented by the number `50`? (Hint: Use the `reverse_word_index` we created).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task 6 (Advanced): Try a Different Optimizer**\n",
    "-   In the `model.compile()` step, change the optimizer from `'adam'` to `'rmsprop'`. Re-train and compare the results."
