## 📘 Introduction

**Univariate Linear Regression** is a fundamental statistical and machine learning technique used to model the relationship between a single independent variable (also known as a feature or predictor) and a dependent variable (also known as a target or response). The goal is to find the best-fitting straight line through the data points that can be used to make predictions.

This relationship is represented by the simple linear equation:

**y = mx + c**

Where:
*   **y** is the dependent variable.
*   **x** is the independent variable.
*   **m** is the slope of the line.
*   **c** is the y-intercept.

In machine learning terminology, this is often written as:

**hθ(x) = θ₀ + θ₁x**

Where:
*   **hθ(x)** is the hypothesis or predicted value.
*   **θ₀** is the bias term (intercept).
*   **θ₁** is the weight for the input feature x (slope).

**Why it matters:** Univariate linear regression is often the first algorithm taught in machine learning because of its simplicity and interpretability. It serves as a foundation for understanding more complex algorithms.

**Gradient Descent** is an iterative optimization algorithm used to find the minimum of a function. In the context of linear regression, it's used to find the optimal values for the parameters (θ₀ and θ₁) that minimize the **cost function**. The cost function measures how well the model is performing by quantifying the difference between the predicted values and the actual values.

This guide will explore how to implement univariate linear regression using gradient descent, both with and without vectorization, to understand the underlying mechanics and the benefits of vectorized computation.

## 🔍 Deep Explanation

### 1. The Core Components

To understand univariate linear regression with gradient descent, we need to be familiar with three key components:

*   **Hypothesis Function:** This is the linear equation our model uses to make predictions.
    *   `hθ(x) = θ₀ + θ₁x`

*   **Cost Function (Mean Squared Error - MSE):** The cost function measures the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual values. Our goal is to minimize this function.
    *   `J(θ₀, θ₁) = (1 / 2m) * Σ(hθ(x⁽ⁱ⁾) - y⁽ⁱ⁾)²`
    *   Where:
        *   `m` is the number of training examples.
        *   `x⁽ⁱ⁾` and `y⁽ⁱ⁾` are the i-th training example.
        *   The `1/2` is a convention to simplify the derivative calculation.

*   **Gradient Descent Algorithm:** This algorithm iteratively adjusts the parameters (θ₀ and θ₁) to minimize the cost function.
    *   It works by taking steps in the direction of the steepest descent of the cost function.
    *   The size of each step is determined by the **learning rate (α)**.

### 2. Gradient Descent Algorithm: Step-by-Step

1.  **Initialize Parameters:** Start with random or zero values for θ₀ and θ₁.
2.  **Calculate the Gradient:** Compute the partial derivatives of the cost function with respect to each parameter. The gradient tells us the direction of the steepest ascent, so we move in the opposite direction.
    *   **For θ₀:** `∂J / ∂θ₀ = (1/m) * Σ(hθ(x⁽ⁱ⁾) - y⁽ⁱ⁾)`
    *   **For θ₁:** `∂J / ∂θ₁ = (1/m) * Σ(hθ(x⁽ⁱ⁾) - y⁽ⁱ⁾) * x⁽ⁱ⁾`
3.  **Update Parameters:** Simultaneously update θ₀ and θ₁ using the gradients and the learning rate.
    *   `θ₀ := θ₀ - α * (∂J / ∂θ₀)`
    *   `θ₁ := θ₁ - α * (∂J / ∂θ₁)`
4.  **Repeat:** Repeat steps 2 and 3 for a fixed number of iterations or until the cost function converges (i.e., the change in cost is negligible).

### 3. Without Vectorization (Using Loops)

In a non-vectorized implementation, we use loops to iterate through each training example to calculate the sum of errors for the gradient.

**The Process:**

1.  Initialize θ₀ and θ₁.
2.  Start a loop for the number of iterations.
3.  Inside this loop, initialize variables for the sum of errors for θ₀ and θ₁ to zero.
4.  Start another loop to iterate through each training example (`i` from 1 to `m`).
    *   Calculate the predicted value: `prediction = θ₀ + θ₁ * x⁽ⁱ⁾`.
    *   Calculate the error: `error = prediction - y⁽ⁱ⁾`.
    *   Add to the sum of errors for θ₀: `sum_error₀ += error`.
    *   Add to the sum of errors for θ₁: `sum_error₁ += error * x⁽ⁱ⁾`.
5.  After the inner loop finishes, calculate the gradients:
    *   `grad₀ = (1/m) * sum_error₀`
    *   `grad₁ = (1/m) * sum_error₁`
6.  Update the parameters:
    *   `θ₀ = θ₀ - α * grad₀`
    *   `θ₁ = θ₁ - α * grad₁`
7.  Repeat for the specified number of iterations.

This approach is intuitive and easy to understand but can be computationally inefficient, especially with large datasets.

### 4. With Vectorization (Using Matrix Operations)

Vectorization allows us to perform calculations on entire arrays or matrices at once, eliminating the need for explicit loops. This is significantly faster due to optimized low-level library implementations (like NumPy in Python).

**The Process:**

1.  **Prepare the Data:**
    *   Create a feature matrix `X` and add a column of ones to accommodate the bias term θ₀.
        *   This makes the hypothesis function a dot product: `hθ(X) = X · θ`.
    *   Create a target vector `y`.
    *   Initialize a parameter vector `θ` with θ₀ and θ₁.

2.  **Vectorized Gradient Descent:**
    *   Initialize `θ`.
    *   Start a loop for the number of iterations.
    *   Calculate predictions for all examples at once: `predictions = X · θ`.
    *   Calculate the error vector: `errors = predictions - y`.
    *   Calculate the gradients using matrix multiplication: `gradient = (1/m) * Xᵀ · errors`.
    *   Update the parameter vector: `θ = θ - α * gradient`.
    *   Repeat for the specified number of iterations.

**Why Vectorization is Faster:**
*   **Parallelism:** Matrix operations can be parallelized to take advantage of modern hardware (CPUs and GPUs).
*   **Reduced Overhead:** Python loops have a higher overhead than optimized C or Fortran code used in libraries like NumPy.

## 💡 Examples

Let's consider a simple dataset where we want to predict a student's exam score based on the number of hours they studied.

| Hours Studied (x) | Exam Score (y) |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 2 |
| 2 | 4 |
| 3 | 5 |
| 4 | 4 |
| 5 | 5 |

### Example 1: Without Vectorization

```python
import numpy as np

# Data
x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
y = np.array([2, 4, 5, 4, 5])

# Parameters
alpha = 0.01
iterations = 1000
m = len(y)
theta0 = 0
theta1 = 0

# Gradient Descent
for _ in range(iterations):
    sum_error0 = 0
    sum_error1 = 0
    for i in range(m):
        prediction = theta0 + theta1 * x[i]
        error = prediction - y[i]
        sum_error0 += error
        sum_error1 += error * x[i]
    
    grad0 = (1/m) * sum_error0
    grad1 = (1/m) * sum_error1
    
    theta0 = theta0 - alpha * grad0
    theta1 = theta1 - alpha * grad1

print(f"Theta0: {theta0}, Theta1: {theta1}")
```

### Example 2: With Vectorization

```python
import numpy as np

# Data
x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
y = np.array([2, 4, 5, 4, 5])

# Parameters
alpha = 0.01
iterations = 1000
m = len(y)

# Add a column of ones to x for the bias term
X = np.c_[np.ones(m), x]
theta = np.zeros(2)

# Gradient Descent
for _ in range(iterations):
    predictions = X.dot(theta)
    errors = predictions - y
    gradient = (1/m) * X.T.dot(errors)
    theta = theta - alpha * gradient

print(f"Theta: {theta}")```

Both examples will converge to similar optimal values for θ₀ and θ₁.
