### 📘 Introduction

A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN or ConvNet)** is a specialized type of deep learning model, particularly effective for processing data with a grid-like topology, such as images and sequences. Inspired by the organization of the animal visual cortex, CNNs automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from the input.

At its core, a CNN learns to detect patterns in data. For images, these patterns could be edges in the initial layers, which are then combined to detect shapes, textures, and eventually objects in deeper layers. For text, these patterns can be motifs or sequences of words (n-grams) that indicate a particular sentiment or topic.

**Why it Matters:** Before CNNs, feature extraction from images was often a manual and complex process. CNNs automate this feature engineering, leading to groundbreaking performance in various tasks. They are the backbone of many modern AI applications, from facial recognition in your phone to autonomous vehicles.

**Scope:** This document will explore two primary applications of CNNs:
*   **2D CNNs for Image Classification:** Analyzing two-dimensional data to assign a label to an entire image (e.g., classifying a picture as a "cat" or a "dog").
*   **1D CNNs for Text Document Classification:** Processing one-dimensional sequential data, like text, to categorize documents (e.g., determining if a movie review is "positive" or "negative").

### 🔍 Deep Explanation

CNNs are composed of several key layers that work together to transform an input (like an image or text) into an output (a class probability). The primary building blocks are the Convolutional Layer, the Pooling Layer, and the Fully Connected Layer.

#### Core Components of a CNN

1.  **Convolutional Layer:** This is the foundational layer of a CNN. It consists of a set of learnable filters (or kernels). These filters are small matrices of weights that slide or "convolve" across the input data. At each position, the filter performs a dot product with the input, creating an activation map or feature map. This process allows the network to detect specific features.
    *   **Parameter Sharing:** The same filter is used across the entire input, which drastically reduces the number of parameters compared to a traditional neural network. This also makes the network **translation invariant**, meaning it can recognize a feature regardless of its position in the input.

2.  **Activation Function (ReLU):** After each convolution operation, an activation function is applied. The most common one is the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), which replaces all negative pixel values in the feature map with zero. This introduces non-linearity into the model, allowing it to learn more complex patterns.

3.  **Pooling Layer (Downsampling):** Pooling layers are used to reduce the spatial dimensions (width and height) of the feature maps. This reduces the computational complexity and helps to make the detected features more robust to small variations in their position.
    *   **Max Pooling:** The most common type, it takes the maximum value from a small window of the feature map.

4.  **Fully Connected Layer:** After several convolutional and pooling layers, the high-level features are "flattened" into a one-dimensional vector. This vector is then fed into a fully connected layer, which is a traditional multilayer perceptron. Its purpose is to use the learned features to perform the final classification.

5.  **Output Layer:** The final layer in the network, which produces the probability distribution over the different classes. For multi-class classification, a `softmax` activation function is typically used.

### 2D CNN for Image Classification

In a 2D CNN, the convolutions are applied over two dimensions (height and width of an image).

#### Step-by-Step Logic for Image Classification:

1.  **Input:** An image is represented as a 3D tensor of shape `(height, width, channels)`. The channels represent the color channels (e.g., 3 for an RGB image).

2.  **Convolution:** A 2D filter (e.g., 3x3 or 5x5) slides over the image. This filter is also a 3D tensor with the same depth as the input image. The convolution operation extracts low-level features like edges, corners, and textures, producing a 2D feature map for each filter.

3.  **Hierarchy of Features:** The initial convolutional layers learn to detect simple features. As the data passes through deeper layers, these features are combined to recognize more complex patterns like shapes and objects. For example, an early layer might identify edges, a subsequent layer might combine these to form an eye, and a later layer could recognize a face.

4.  **Pooling:** Max pooling is applied to the feature maps to reduce their dimensionality while retaining the most important information.

5.  **Classification:** The final feature maps are flattened and passed to a fully connected network which learns the relationship between the features and the different classes. The output layer then provides the probability for each class.

💡 ### Example: 2D CNN for MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition

Let's consider classifying a 28x28 grayscale image of a handwritten digit from the MNIST dataset.

1.  **Input:** A 28x28x1 tensor representing the image.

2.  **First Convolutional Layer:**
    *   Apply 32 filters of size 3x3.
    *   This will produce 32 feature maps, each highlighting different aspects of the digits (e.g., curves, straight lines).
    *   The output would be a 26x26x32 tensor (assuming no padding).

3.  **First Pooling Layer:**
    *   Apply max pooling with a 2x2 window.
    *   This halves the spatial dimensions, resulting in a 13x13x32 tensor.

4.  **Second Convolutional and Pooling Layers:**
    *   Another convolutional layer with 64 filters of size 3x3 could be applied, followed by another max pooling layer. This would further extract more complex features and reduce the dimensions.

5.  **Flattening and Fully Connected Layers:**
    *   The resulting tensor is flattened into a 1D vector.
    *   This vector is fed into one or more fully connected layers.

6.  **Output Layer:**
    *   A final fully connected layer with 10 neurons (one for each digit from 0 to 9) and a `softmax` activation function will output the probability of the image belonging to each digit class.

### 1D CNN for Text Document Classification

For text data, we use a 1D CNN where the convolution is performed in one dimension (along the sequence of words).

#### Step-by-Step Logic for Text Classification:

1.  **Text Preprocessing:**
    *   **Tokenization:** The text is broken down into individual words or tokens.
    *   **Integer Encoding:** Each unique word is assigned a unique integer.
    *   **Padding:** All sentences are padded to have the same length.

2.  **Embedding Layer:** The integer-encoded words are passed through an embedding layer. This layer maps each integer to a dense vector of a fixed size (the word embedding). This vector representation captures the semantic meaning of the words. The result is a 2D tensor of shape `(sequence_length, embedding_dimension)`.

3.  **Convolution:** A 1D filter (of shape `(filter_size, embedding_dimension)`) slides over the sequence of word embeddings. The `filter_size` can be thought of as the number of words the filter considers at a time (similar to an n-gram). For example, a filter of size 3 would look at trigrams. Different filters can be used to capture different n-gram patterns.

4.  **Pooling:** Similar to 2D CNNs, a pooling layer (usually max-over-time pooling) is applied to the feature maps. This takes the most significant feature (the maximum value) from each feature map, regardless of its position in the sentence.

5.  **Classification:** The outputs from the pooling layer are concatenated and fed into a fully connected network for the final classification.

💡 ### Example: 1D CNN for Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews

Let's classify a movie review as "positive" or "negative".

1.  **Input:** A sentence like "The movie was fantastic!".

2.  **Preprocessing & Embedding:**
    *   The sentence is tokenized and converted to a sequence of integers.
    *   An embedding layer transforms this into a matrix, where each row is the vector for a word.

3.  **Convolutional Layer:**
    *   We can use multiple filter sizes, for example, 2, 3, and 4, to capture bigram, trigram, and 4-gram patterns.
    *   A filter of size 3 would convolve over "The movie was", "movie was fantastic", etc., producing feature maps that highlight important word combinations.

4.  **Max-Over-Time Pooling:**
    *   For each feature map generated by the different filter sizes, we take the maximum value. This captures the most important signal from that filter.

5.  **Flattening and Fully Connected Layers:**
    *   The maximum values are combined into a single vector.
    *   This vector is passed to a fully connected layer.

6.  **Output Layer:**
    *   A final layer with a `sigmoid` activation function outputs a probability between 0 and 1, indicating the sentiment (e.g., > 0.5 is positive).

*   **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):** Another type of neural network designed for sequential data. While CNNs are good at detecting local patterns, RNNs are designed to capture long-range dependencies in sequences.
