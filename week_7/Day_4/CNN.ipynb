    "\n",
    "A **Convolutional Neural Network** (CNN or ConvNet) is a special type of AI model inspired by how the human brain's visual cortex works. It's incredibly good at processing data that has a grid-like structure, like an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why does it matter?** Before CNNs, teaching a computer to recognize objects in pictures was very difficult and required a lot of manual work to extract features (like edges, corners, and colors). CNNs learn to do this **automatically**! They learn to see patterns, starting with simple edges and building up to complex objects like faces or cars.\n",
    "\n",
    "This automated feature learning is what makes CNNs the backbone of modern AI applications."
