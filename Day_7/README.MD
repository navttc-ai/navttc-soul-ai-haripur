## üèóÔ∏è Hour 1: The Building Blocks

### Classes and Objects

> **Analogy:** A `class` is like a cookie cutter üç™. An `object` is the actual cookie made from that cutter.

A **class** serves as a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines attributes (data) and methods (behaviors) that objects will have.

```python
# The Class (Blueprint)
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        self.name = name      # Attribute
        self.breed = breed    # Attribute
    
    def bark(self):          # Method
        print(f"{self.name} says Woof!")

# Creating Objects (Instances)
my_dog = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever")
your_dog = Dog("Lucy", "Poodle")

print(my_dog.name)  # Output: Buddy
your_dog.bark()     # Output: Lucy says Woof!
```

**üí° Think About It:** Design a `Car` class with three attributes and two methods. What would they be?

### Instance Variables and Methods

**Instance Variables:** Data unique to each object (like a student's name)
**Instance Methods:** Functions that operate on an object's data using `self`

```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, student_id):
        self.name = name              # Instance variable
        self.student_id = student_id  # Instance variable
    
    def show_details(self):           # Instance method
        print(f"ID: {self.student_id}, Name: {self.name}")

# Usage
s1 = Student("Alice", "FTU001")
s2 = Student("Bob", "FTU002")
s1.show_details()  # Output: ID: FTU001, Name: Alice
```

**‚ùì Question:** Why is `self` required as the first parameter in instance methods?

### Class Variables and Methods

**Class Variables:** Shared data across all instances
**Class Methods:** Actions related to the class as a whole, using `cls`

```python
class Employee:
    company_name = "Innovate Inc."  # Class variable (shared by all)
    
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name            # Instance variable (unique to each)
    
    @classmethod
    def get_company(cls):           # Class method
        return f"Company: {cls.company_name}"

# Usage
emp1 = Employee("John")
emp2 = Employee("Jane")
print(Employee.get_company())       # Output: Company: Innovate Inc.
```

**üí≠ Consider:** When would you use a class variable instead of an instance variable?

### Constructors and Destructors

**Constructor (`__init__`):** Called automatically when an object is created
**Destructor (`__del__`):** Called when an object is about to be destroyed

```python
class FileHandler:
    def __init__(self, filename):
        print(f"CONSTRUCTOR: Opening '{filename}'...")
        self.file = open(filename, 'w')
    
    def __del__(self):
        print("DESTRUCTOR: Closing file...")
        self.file.close()

# Usage
log = FileHandler("app.log")  # Constructor called
# Destructor called automatically when 'log' goes out of scope
```

---

## üîó Hour 2-3: Building Relationships

### Single Inheritance

Creates an "is-a" relationship where a child class inherits from a parent class.

```python
class Vehicle:  # Parent class
    def start_engine(self):
        print("Engine starting...")
    
    def stop_engine(self):
        print("Engine stopping...")

class Car(Vehicle):  # Child class inherits from Vehicle
    def drive(self):
        print("Driving the car...")

# Usage
my_car = Car()
my_car.start_engine()  # Inherited method
my_car.drive()         # Own method
```

**üéØ Benefit:** Code reusability - no need to duplicate common functionality.

### Multilevel & Hierarchical Inheritance

**Multilevel:** Chain of inheritance (A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C)
**Hierarchical:** One parent, multiple children (A ‚Üí B, A ‚Üí C)

```python
# Multilevel Inheritance
class Organism:
    def breathe(self):
        print("Breathing...")

class Animal(Organism):
    def move(self):
        print("Moving...")

class Dog(Animal):  # Inherits from both Animal and Organism
    def bark(self):
        print("Barking...")

# Hierarchical Inheritance
class Shape:
    def area(self):
        pass

class Circle(Shape):    # Child 1
    def draw(self):
        print("Drawing circle")

class Square(Shape):    # Child 2 (sibling to Circle)
    def draw(self):
        print("Drawing square")
```

**üîç Challenge:** Provide real-world examples of both inheritance types.

### Multiple Inheritance & Method Resolution Order

A class can inherit from multiple parent classes, combining their functionalities.

```python
class Swimmer:
    def swim(self):
        print("Swimming...")

class Flyer:
    def fly(self):
        print("Flying...")

class Duck(Swimmer, Flyer):  # Multiple inheritance
    def quack(self):
        print("Quacking...")

# Usage
donald = Duck()
donald.swim()   # From Swimmer
donald.fly()    # From Flyer
donald.quack()  # Own method

# Check Method Resolution Order
print(Duck.mro())  # Shows the search order for methods
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** MRO prevents ambiguity when multiple parents have methods with the same name.

---

## üîí Hour 4: Encapsulation and Structure

### Access Specifiers

Python uses naming conventions to indicate intended access levels:

```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.account_number = "12345"    # Public
        self._holder_name = "John Doe"   # Protected (convention)
        self.__balance = balance         # Private (name mangled)
    
    def get_balance(self):  # Public method to access private data
        return self.__balance

# Usage
account = BankAccount(1000)
print(account.account_number)    # ‚úÖ Public - accessible
print(account._holder_name)      # ‚ö†Ô∏è Protected - accessible but shouldn't
# print(account.__balance)       # ‚ùå Private - AttributeError
print(account.get_balance())     # ‚úÖ Proper way to access private data
```

| Access Level | Notation | Description |
|--------------|----------|-------------|
| **Public** | `name` | Accessible everywhere (default) |
| **Protected** | `_name` | Internal use or subclasses only |
| **Private** | `__name` | Class use only (name mangled) |

### Name Mangling

Python automatically renames private attributes to prevent accidental access:

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__secret = "top_secret"

obj = MyClass()
# print(obj.__secret)           # ‚ùå AttributeError
print(obj._MyClass__secret)     # ‚úÖ Works (but don't do this!)
```

**üõ°Ô∏è Purpose:** Prevents accidental override of private attributes in subclasses.

### Inner/Nested Classes

A class defined inside another class, used when one class is logically a component of another:

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, model):
        self.model = model
        self.engine = self.Engine("V8")  # Create inner class instance
    
    class Engine:  # Inner/Nested class
        def __init__(self, engine_type):
            self.type = engine_type
        
        def start(self):
            print(f"{self.type} engine starting...")

# Usage
my_car = Car("Mustang")
print(my_car.engine.type)    # Output: V8
my_car.engine.start()        # Output: V8 engine starting...
```

**ü§î Why nest classes?** When a class is only meaningful in the context of another class.

### Object Relationships

Different ways objects can be connected based on their lifecycles:

#### üîó Association ("uses-a")
Independent lifecycles - objects can exist separately.

```python
class Doctor:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def treat(self, patient):
        print(f"Dr. {self.name} treating {patient.name}")

class Patient:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

# Both can exist independently
doctor = Doctor("Smith")
patient = Patient("Alice")
doctor.treat(patient)
```

#### üì¶ Aggregation ("has-a")
The "part" can exist without the "whole".

```python
class Professor:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

class Department:
    def __init__(self, name, professors):
        self.name = name
        self.professors = professors  # Department "has" professors
    
    def list_professors(self):
        for prof in self.professors:
            print(f"Professor: {prof.name}")

# Professors exist independently
prof1 = Professor("Dr. Turing")
prof2 = Professor("Dr. Lovelace")
cs_dept = Department("Computer Science", [prof1, prof2])
```

#### üîê Composition ("owns-a")
The "part" is destroyed with the "whole" - stronger relationship.

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.heart = self.Heart()  # Heart created inside Person
    
    class Heart:
        def __init__(self):
            self.beats_per_minute = 72
        
        def beat(self):
            print("Lub-dub")

# Heart cannot exist without Person
person = Person("John")
person.heart.beat()  # Heart is part of person
```

**üîë Key Difference:** In composition, the "part" is created and destroyed with the "whole".

## üèÜ Capstone Project: University Management System

Build a comprehensive system demonstrating all OOP concepts learned:

### Requirements:

1. **Base Class:** Create a `Person` class with `name` and `age`
2. **Hierarchical Inheritance:** Create `Student` and `Professor` classes inheriting from `Person`
   - `Student` must have a private `__student_id`
   - `Professor` must have a protected `_employee_id`
3. **Class Variable:** Add `university_name` class variable to `Person`
4. **Composition & Nested Class:** Create a `Department` class with nested `Office` class
5. **Aggregation:** `Department` should accept a list of `Professor` objects
6. **Demonstration:** Create objects and show all relationships

### Sample Implementation:

```python
class Person:
    university_name = "Tech University"  # Class variable
    
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    
    def display_info(self):
        print(f"Name: {self.name}, Age: {self.age}, University: {self.university_name}")

class Student(Person):  # Hierarchical inheritance
    def __init__(self, name, age, student_id):
        super().__init__(name, age)
        self.__student_id = student_id  # Private
    
    def get_student_id(self):
        return self.__student_id

class Professor(Person):  # Hierarchical inheritance
    def __init__(self, name, age, employee_id):
        super().__init__(name, age)
        self._employee_id = employee_id  # Protected
    
    def get_employee_id(self):
        return self._employee_id

class Department:
    def __init__(self, dept_name, professors):
        self.dept_name = dept_name
        self.professors = professors      # Aggregation
        self.office = self.Office("A101")  # Composition
    
    class Office:  # Nested class
        def __init__(self, room_number):
            self.room_number = room_number
        
        def get_location(self):
            return f"Room {self.room_number}"
    
    def list_faculty(self):
        print(f"\n{self.dept_name} Faculty:")
        for prof in self.professors:
            print(f"- {prof.name} (ID: {prof.get_employee_id()})")

# Demonstration
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create professors (exist independently)
    prof1 = Professor("Dr. Alan Turing", 45, "EMP001")
    prof2 = Professor("Dr. Ada Lovelace", 38, "EMP002")
    
    # Create department with aggregation
    cs_dept = Department("Computer Science", [prof1, prof2])
    
    # Create student
    student = Student("Alice Johnson", 20, "STU001")
    
    # Demonstrate all concepts
    print("=== University Management System ===")
    
    # Display person info
    prof1.display_info()
    student.display_info()
    
    # Show department faculty (aggregation)
    cs_dept.list_faculty()
    
    # Show office location (composition)
    print(f"Department Office: {cs_dept.office.get_location()}")
    
    # Access private member through method
    print(f"Student ID: {student.get_student_id()}")
```
