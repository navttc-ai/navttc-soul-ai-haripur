    "Testing in machine learning is the process of checking every part of your ML system to make sure it works correctly, reliably, and fairly.

    "- **Unit Tests:** Testing small, individual pieces of code (like a data cleaning function).\n",

    "- **Data Testing:** Checking if your data is accurate, complete, and in the right format.\n",
    "- **Model Validation:** Seeing how well your trained model performs on new, unseen data.\n",
    "- **A/B Testing:** Comparing two different models in a live environment to see which one performs better in the real world."
